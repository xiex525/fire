# Data Management

Fire provides a user-friendly interface for downloading and managing financial data. By leveraging the pre-cleaned and processed data pipeline from the Fire Institute, you can focus more on research and modeling rather than data preparation.


Currently, Fire only porvides the data from the Chinese A stock market. We will provide more data in the future.
