from [here](https://github.com/fire-institute/fire/releases/download/marketdata/AStockData.tar.gz)

run the command and download data put in correct path automatically.

```bash
# We have not released this repo yet, so you need download the data manually!!! See command below!!!
# Auto download data
firefin download
```

If you have already downloaded the data from [here](https://github.com/fire-institute/fire/releases/download/marketdata/AStockData.tar.gz), you can run the command to check the data and put the data in the correct path

## Start to code

```python
import firefin

# get data
data = firefin.fetch_data(["open", "close", "volume"])
open_price = data["open"]


def pv_corr(close, volume):
    # price volume correlation
    return close.rolling(20).corr(volume)


factor = pv_corr(data["close"], data["volume"])

# compute forward returns
fr = firefin.compute_forward_returns(open_price.shift(-1), [1, 5, 10])

# evaluate factor
mng = firefin.Evaluator(factor, fr)
mng.get_ic("pearson")
mng.get_quantile_returns(5)

```
